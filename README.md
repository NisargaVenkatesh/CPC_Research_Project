# Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) for Audio Representation Learning

This project implements **Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)** for self-supervised learning of audio representations using PyTorch.

CPC learns meaningful features from raw audio **without labels** by predicting future representations using contrastive loss.

##  Getting Started

### 1. Create Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
conda create -n cpc-env python=3.9
conda activate cpc-env
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the CPC Model:
    
    python main.py

Trains encoder and autoregressive model using CPC loss
Logs loss and saves models to checkpoints/
Training hyperparameters in config.yaml

3. Extract Embeddings:
    After training:

    python extract_embeddings.py

Saves averaged encoder features to embeddings/embeddings.npy
Saves speaker labels to embeddings/labels.npy

4. Visualize Embeddings:

    python visualize_embeddings.py

    Runs t-SNE to reduce 512D embeddings to 2D
    Outputs tsne_embeddings.png to inspect learned structure

5. Evaluate with Classification

    python train_classifier.py

    Trains a simple classifier (Logistic Regression)
    Evaluates performance (e.g., speaker identification)

6. Training Output
    Training loss plot: training_loss.png
    Best model: encoder_best.pth, ar_model_best.pth
    Final model: encoder.pth, ar_model.pth
